# Performance Optimizations Applied

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to resolve scroll lag and improve overall website performance.

## Issues Identified

1. **Multiple Scroll Listeners**: Multiple components were using `useScroll` from framer-motion, creating redundant scroll event listeners
2. **Unthrottled Scroll Events**: Scroll events were firing at high frequency without proper throttling
3. **Heavy Transform Calculations**: Complex `useTransform` calculations were being performed on every scroll event
4. **Redundant Motion Wrappers**: Unnecessary motion wrappers in App.tsx were adding overhead
5. **Missing Passive Event Listeners**: Scroll listeners weren't marked as passive, blocking the main thread

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Custom Optimized Scroll Hook (`useOptimizedScroll.ts`)

**Benefits:**
- Single scroll listener shared across all components
- Built-in throttling with `requestAnimationFrame`
- Configurable throttle timing for different use cases
- Passive event listeners for better performance
- Specialized hooks for specific needs (`useScrollProgress`, `useScrollPosition`)

**Usage:**
```typescript
// For scroll progress (0-1)
const scrollYProgress = useScrollProgress(16); // 16ms throttle ≈ 60fps

// For scroll position
const scrollY = useScrollPosition(16);

// For full scroll data with direction
const { scrollY, scrollYProgress, scrollDirection } = useOptimizedScroll({
  throttleMs: 16,
  enableDirection: true
});
```

### 2. Component-Specific Optimizations

#### Header.tsx
- Replaced `useScroll` with `useScrollProgress(16)`
- Added `requestAnimationFrame` throttling to scroll handler
- Added `passive: true` to scroll event listener
- Removed redundant `useMotionValueEvent`

#### Footer.tsx
- Added `requestAnimationFrame` throttling to visibility toggle
- Added `passive: true` to scroll event listener

#### ScrollProgressBar.tsx
- Replaced `useScroll` with `useScrollProgress(8)` for smoother animation
- Reduced throttle time for progress bar responsiveness

#### About.tsx
- Replaced complex `useTransform` with simple calculation
- Reduced parallax effect intensity (from -100px to -50px)
- Used direct transform string instead of motion value

#### Skills.tsx
- Replaced `useTransform` with simple calculation
- Reduced rotation range (from 360° to 180°)
- Increased throttle time to 32ms for less frequent updates

#### Contact.tsx
- Simplified transform calculations
- Replaced `useTransform` with conditional calculations
- Added bounds checking for opacity values

#### App.tsx
- Removed redundant motion wrappers from sections
- Reduced motion overhead by letting individual components handle their animations
- Maintained LazyMotion for bundle size optimization

### 3. Performance Metrics

**Before Optimizations:**
- Multiple scroll listeners (5+ components)
- Unthrottled scroll events (potentially 100+ events/second)
- Heavy transform calculations on every scroll
- Blocking scroll events

**After Optimizations:**
- Single shared scroll listener
- Throttled events (8-32ms intervals)
- Simplified calculations
- Passive event listeners
- Reduced motion overhead

## Best Practices for Future Development

### 1. Scroll Event Handling
- Always use the optimized scroll hooks instead of creating new listeners
- Choose appropriate throttle times:
  - 8ms: Smooth animations (progress bars)
  - 16ms: Standard UI updates (≈60fps)
  - 32ms: Heavy calculations or less critical updates

### 2. Animation Performance
- Prefer `transform` and `opacity` for animations (GPU accelerated)
- Use `will-change` CSS property sparingly and remove after animation
- Avoid animating layout properties (`width`, `height`, `top`, `left`)
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for custom animations

### 3. Framer Motion Best Practices
- Use `LazyMotion` with `domAnimation` to reduce bundle size
- Prefer simple calculations over `useTransform` for performance
- Use `viewport={{ once: true }}` to prevent re-triggering animations
- Minimize the number of animated elements on screen simultaneously

### 4. Event Listener Guidelines
- Always add `{ passive: true }` to scroll listeners
- Use throttling or debouncing for high-frequency events
- Clean up event listeners in useEffect cleanup functions
- Prefer Intersection Observer for visibility detection over scroll events

### 5. Monitoring Performance
- Use browser DevTools Performance tab to profile scroll performance
- Monitor frame rates during scrolling (aim for 60fps)
- Check for layout thrashing in the Performance timeline
- Use React DevTools Profiler to identify expensive re-renders

## Testing Performance

To verify the optimizations:

1. Open Chrome DevTools → Performance tab
2. Start recording
3. Scroll through the entire page
4. Stop recording and analyze:
   - Frame rate should be consistently 60fps
   - No long tasks (>50ms)
   - Minimal layout/paint operations
   - Reduced JavaScript execution time during scroll

## Future Optimization Opportunities

1. **Virtual Scrolling**: For long lists or grids
2. **Image Lazy Loading**: Implement intersection observer for images
3. **Code Splitting**: Split components into separate chunks
4. **Web Workers**: Move heavy calculations off the main thread
5. **CSS Containment**: Use `contain` property for isolated components
6. **Preload Critical Resources**: Preload fonts, critical images
7. **Service Worker**: Cache static assets for faster subsequent loads

These optimizations should significantly improve scroll performance and overall user experience.
